In this single web page application I used the following resources:
- knockout.js -3.2.0 framework (to bind list of neighbours using ModelView)
- media wiki api (to find nearest up to 50 neighbours from the center point with radius=10000 meters)
- jquery.min.js library to operate with DOM
- api.bart.gov resourse to retrieve BART locations (center in San Francisco)
- ajax library to use GET requests to the media wiki or api.bart.gov and received
  data in JSON format
  How to run this project: just double click on index.html file (or right click on index.html -> open with -> 
select any browser you use).
